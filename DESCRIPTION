Description: Integrates datasets from the 'QUINT' workflow with additional details from the 'Allen CCFv3 Ontogeny'.
    The main function is to sum Object count, Object area, Object pixels, Region pixels and Region area according 
    to each region's position in the hierarchy. All sub-nuclei data is summed to produce a total for each parent 
    region. E.G. 10 cells in the nucleus accumbens come from summing the child structures 2 cells in the nucleus 
    accumbens core and 8 in the nucleus accumbens shell. This "summing up the hierarchy" is applied to all structures 
    and sub-structures and then output into a list object and saved as a .csv file.
